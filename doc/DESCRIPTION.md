Nextcloud lets you access and synchronize data, files, contacts and calendars between different devices (PCs or mobiles), or share them with other people (with or without accounts), and also offers advanced communication and collaborative working features. Nextcloud features its own application mechanism (see also [Nextcloud's app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/)) for specific functionalities.

In the context of YunoHost, Nextcloud integrates with the SSO/User Portal (YunoHost accounts are automatically connected to Nextcloud).

The `/.well-known` address will be automatically configured for CalDAV and CardDAV synchronization if no other service such as Baïkal is already using it.

- Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
- Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
- Allow multiple instances of this application
- Optionally access the user home folder from Nextcloud files (set at the installation, the sharing is enabled by default)
- Serve `/.well-known` paths for CalDAV and CardDAV on the domain only if it's not already served - i.e. by Baïkal
